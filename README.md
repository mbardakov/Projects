## TextPredict (Java):    

Simulates a phone's word prediction. Creates a HashMap of [target word] -> [all words that immediately follow target word].

## Arenafy (AngularJS):     

Gets a list of items from the user, then gets the user to "rank" them implicitly. This is done by choosing two items at random and getting the user to choose one of the two; the "winner" has its rating increased, and the loser's rating is decreased. This uses a simple Performace Rating (PR) system similar to what is used in chess tournaments, online games, and other competitions.
